let me explain how our ears process sound—it’s actually pretty fascinating! So, the ear has three main parts: the outer ear, the middle ear, and the inner ear.

First, in the outer ear, sound waves travel into your ear and hit this thin membrane called the eardrum. The eardrum vibrates depending on the loudness and pitch of the sound—it’s like a drum being played by the air.

Next, those vibrations move into the middle ear. This part acts a bit like a filter, letting certain frequencies pass through while dampening others. Think of it as the bouncer at a concert, deciding what gets in.

Finally, we have the inner ear. This is where the magic happens! Inside, there’s this coiled structure called the cochlea, which has a basilar membrane running through it. The basilar membrane is like your personal spectrum analyzer—it’s sensitive to different frequencies at different spots. That’s how you can distinguish between, say, a high-pitched violin and a deep bass drum.
